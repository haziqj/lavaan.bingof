  abstract = {The effect of stratification and clustering on the asymptotic distributions of standard Pearson chi-squared test statistics for goodness of fit (simple hypothesis) and independence in a two-way contingency table, denoted as X\textsuperscript{2} and X\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{1}, respectively, is investigated. It is shown that both X\textsuperscript{2} and X\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{1} are asymptotically distributed as weighted sums of independent {$\chi$}\textsubscript{1}\textsuperscript{2} random variables. The weights are then related to the familiar design effects (deffs) used by survey samplers. A simple correction to X\textsuperscript{2}, which requires only the knowledge of variance estimates (or deffs) for individual cells in the goodness-of-fit problem, is proposed and empirical results on the performance of corrected X\textsuperscript{2} provided. Empirical work on X\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{1} indicated that the distortion of nominal significance level is substantially smaller with X\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{1} than with X\textsuperscript{2}. Some results under simple models for clustering are also given.},
