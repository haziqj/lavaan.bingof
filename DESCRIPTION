Description: This is the accompanying R package for the paper "Goodness-of-fit tests for composite likelihood estimation under simple random and complex survey sampling". After fitting a binary factor model in lavaan, the user can call several functions to compute the goodness-of-fit test statistics based off of lower order marginals and compute the corresponding p-values.
